# **NAME**

Good_Turing.R - Calculate probability of unobserved species for molecular dynamics RMSD matrices.

# **DESCRIPTION**

Good_Turing.R is an [R](http://www.r-project.org/) script which applies Good-Turing statistics on an
RMSD matrices of macromolecular dynamics simulation trajectories, with the purpose of quantifying
convergence and/or sufficient sampling. 

The following steps are required in order to run the script :

1. Obtain and install R
    If you are on a windows machine follow the link provided above to obtain the R installer for your platform.
